# WCFPOPS
This project is titled "Purchase Order Processing System(POPS)".

The back-end is a small database with four tables containing the details of suppliers, items and purchase orders.

The middle layer will be a WCF Service which performs the CRUD operations on the database.

ADO.NET will be used to access the database.

The front-end is a Windows Forms application.
